== ARTICLE VI

=== Delinquency

==== Section 1

Dues are paid on a monthly basis. A dues payment covers an entire month regardless of the day on which it was paid. A member who has not paid dues for the two-month period prior to the current month is considered in Bad Standing(((bad standing, delinquency))) and is not entitled to any rights or benefits in the IWW until they have been paid. A branch may vote to allow a member in Bad Standing to participate in branch business meetings with voice, but no vote.

After 3 months in bad standing, a 5 month period of unpaid dues prior to the current month, members are considered to be in inactive standing and cannot take part in business meetings.

==== Section 2

Delinquent delegates are members in bad standing. Delinquency of delegates shall be defined by the Industrial Union to which the delegate belongs.

==== Section 3

All General Organizing Committee traveling delegates and branch secretaries when issuing credentials shall mark in delegate’s membership card the number of the credentials issued with the date, and by whom issued.

When a delegate’s account is cleared, the Clearinghouse shall issue them a clearance stamp to be affixed on their membership card.
