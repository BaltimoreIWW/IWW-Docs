== ARTICLE III

=== Complaints Against Members and Conflict Resolution

==== Section 1

[loweralpha]
. A complaint by a member of one IWW branch against any other IWW member shall be in writing, or a verbal complaint to an officer, who would then be required to put the complaint in writing within 24 hours giving a full account of the incident or incidents concerned, together with the names of any witnesses and their statements regarding the offenses of which the defendant is accused. The plaintiff must be a member in good standing to make a complaint.

. Mediation, as outlined in Bylaws, Article XIV, is the preferred means of conflict resolution in the IWW, followed by the Complaint Procedure (Sections 3, 5 and 6 of this Article).

. In the event that a complaint alleges harassment, violence, discrimination, or other unwanted actions of a sexual nature, or where the sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, gender presentation, etc. of one or more of the involved parties acts as a locus of oppression or is otherwise central to the complaint, the complainant may opt to access the Conflict Resolution Committee For Matters of Gender, as outlined in the MPP.

=== Offenses

[loweralpha, start==4]
. Among the offenses for which remedial actions, discipline and penalties may be imposed against any member, or branch, or industrial union or other grouping:
[arabic]
.. willfully failing to comply with the Preamble, Constitution, or laws of the IWW, or the grouping to which they belong.

.. engaging in corruption, financial malpractice in respect of the funds or property of the organization.

.. attempting to secede, merge, dissolve or destroy any local or group of the IWW contrary to the provisions in the Constitution.

.. bringing false charges with malicious intent against a member, officer, or grouping of the Union.

.. harassment and hiscrimination

.. unilteral publication of accusations identifying a person as an IWW member, outside of IWW-controlled media, is a violation of confidentiality clauses (Bylaws Article III Section 7(e)).

The remedial actions, discipline or penalties which may be imposed can include censure, temporary suspension, disqualification or removal from office or official position, expulsion, or any combination thereof.

=== Harassment and Discrimination

==== Section 2

[loweralpha]
. The focus of action against discrimination and harassment is protecting and supporting the complainant, to make the accused gain insight into the effects of their behavior, to prevent future incidents, and to improve awareness of harassment and discrimination and further a culture of solidarity and equality in the IWW.

. In the case of harassment or discrimination there is no need to show that harassment was the intended effect. A person can commit harassment without intending to do so. The deciding factor in initiating the complaint or mediation process is that the complainant perceives harassment to be taking place.

. If a member is behaving inappropriately they should be told their behavior is unwelcome and asked to stop. If the complainant does not feel comfortable speaking to the member in question, they should report the incident to a branch secretary, or other officer as soon as possible. The officer will facilitate the completion of a written statement as per Section 1.(a).

. Within 24 hours of receiving a complaint, the officer will arrange a confidential meeting with the complainant to take place as soon as possible, but no later than 6 days after the incident was reported, in which the complainant will decide whether or not to pursue mediation under Bylaws Article XIV or the Complaint Procedure (Sections 3, 5, and 6 of this Article). The officer will also provide information on Victims Services. If mediation is chosen, and the complainant desires anonymity, the mediator shall meet with the accused without identifying the complainant.

. Depending on the severity of the harassment or discrimination taking place remedial action can lead to action up to expulsion. A written report, including a minute of any mediation or complaints proceedings that have already been pursued, shall be provided to the committee or any other body charged with recommending further action.

=== Jurisdiction

==== Section 3

Complaints shall be submitted in writing to the secretary of the branch or to an alternate officer, if the secretary has a conflict of interest regarding the complaint.

[loweralpha]
. If complaints are against a member who is not part of the same branch, complaints shall be submitted to the secretary of the defendant’s branch.

. If the defendant does not belong to any branch, or if no agreement can be reached as to which branch or which individuals in a branch are to form a complaints committee, complaints shall be submitted to the General Executive Board. The GEB shall appoint a neutral branch that agrees to hear the complaint no later than two weeks after the complaint was submitted. The GEB shall appoint the branch by a majority vote.

. Any GEB member with a conflict of interest in the complaint shall abstain from participating in this selection process.

=== Terms of Immediate Relief

==== Section 4

The complainant may request immediate relief at any point before or during the mediation or complaints procedure.

[loweralpha]
. The complainant sends a written request to a branch officer, or gives a verbal complaint to an officer, who must then put it in writing within 24 hours. The request can include:
* that the accused refrain from contacting the complainant;
* that the accused alternate attending events with the complainant, using a neutral; third-party to communicate;
* that the accused refrain from attending union functions;
* any other remedial action to be taken by the accused.

. The officer has 24 hours to submit the request to the accused.

. Upon receipt of the request, the accused has 24 hours to respond to the officer. The accused can accept or reject any or all of the requests. The accused can also add suggestions on steps they will take to provide immediate relief. This is submitted to the officer in the form of a written response. Failure of the accused to respond within 24 hours will lead to the branch voting on the request (see below).

. The officer has 24 hours to submit the written response of the accused to the complainant.

. If the complainant accepts the written response of immediate relief then both the accused and complainant are in agreement on the terms of immediate relief. The complainant has 24 hours to notify the branch officer that they accept the response and all branch officers are responsible for enforcing the agreement. The agreement is only valid until the date of conflict mediation or the date that the branch votes on the findings of the charges committee.

. (enumerated as (g) in official current IWW Constitution PDF) If the complainant and accused cannot agree on the terms of immediate relief, the branch holds an emergency vote in which they vote on each of the complainant’s requests. The branch officer must call for the vote within 24 hours of the complainant contacting them that there is no agreement, and the vote must take place within 72 hours. The vote can take place at a special meeting called by the branch officer. Any members in good standing who cannot attend the meeting can submit their vote to the branch officer prior to the meeting. To call for the meeting, the officer sends out a proposed meeting date and requests responses within 5 hours. If a quorum is not able to attend, the vote takes place over the listserv, with written responses from the complainant and accused being submitted to the list. Members not present on the listserv may be communicated with by phone. Members wishing to keep their vote private may email their vote to a branch officer. The duration of the vote will be 72 hours to give members ample time to read and consider the request and cast their vote. All branch officers are responsible for enforcing the agreement that the members vote on. The agreement is only valid until the date of conflict mediation or the date that the branch votes on the findings of the charges committee.

=== Complaint Committee Election

==== Section 5

[loweralpha]
. The complaints shall be read during the next regular branch meeting, at which time no less than three and no more than five members shall be elected from the floor of the meeting to act as a complaint committee. This meeting must be called no later than two weeks after the complaint was received. The complainant and the accused shall have neither voice nor vote in the election of the complaint committee nor can either party act on same. No member with a conflict of interest may be elected to the committee.

. In the event a complaint is sent to General Convention, its delegates shall elect a Complaint Committee of at least three and no more than five IWW members in good standing, who have accepted their nomination and have no conflict of interest. Convention delegates shall set a timeline of no more than 60 days from the end of Convention to conduct an investigation and hearing, at the end of which the committee shall submit its report, ruling and recommendations to the GEB and the parties to the complaint.

. Should a committee member resign, the GEB may appoint a replacement at the request of the committee.

. Convention delegates have the discretion to elect as many committees as are necessary to ensure each complaint is heard. Convention delegates also may designate the Complaint Committee as a standing committee to hear other complaints up to the start of the next Convention, in the event that no branch can be found to hear a complaint or the GEB finds itself unable to hear a complaint due to conflict of interest.

. Election of a Standing Complaint and Appeal Committee must be specified in the original motion to strike a Complaint Committee. Alternatively, a standing committee can be separately elected by the General Convention.

=== Committee Procedures

==== Section 6

[loweralpha]
. The committee shall furnish the accused with a true copy of the complaints by mail, e-mail with receipt acknowledged or by personal delivery in the presence of a witness.

. The complaints committee shall set a date for a hearing within one week of its election and shall collect all evidence both supporting and refuting the complaint.

. Complaints shall be related to matters that impact the union. A defendant is innocent until proven guilty. The onus of proof is on the plaintiff to provide sufficient oral, written or otherwise relevant evidence to the committee that:
[lowerroman]
.. the complaint is directly related to the union’s affairs and the rights of its members, and

.. the complaint has a basis in fact.
Complaints that do not meet these two conditions can be dismissed by the committee. No complaint shall be heard by any IWW body without first fulfilling these requirements.

. The committee shall not allow amendments to complaints under their consideration, and shall restrict their activities to items directly related to the original written complaint. Additional complaints shall be submitted separately, and shall follow the same procedures.

. Within 30 days of its election, the committee shall conduct its hearing and submit its findings together with the complaints and evidence to the next regular meeting of the branch or related body, at which time the membership will accept or reject the recommendation of the committee.

. The committee may recommend suspension, expulsion, restitution or other remedy.

. If the findings are accepted by the branch, the decision shall at once be sent by mail to General Headquarters.

=== Rights of Members

==== Section 7

[loweralpha]
. All members are equal under the IWW Constitution and shall not be discriminated against on the basis of their race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, or mental or physical disability.

. No member’s card shall be taken up without the action of a regular business meeting, conference or convention.

. No member of the IWW shall be suspended for more than 90 days.

. No publicity in union media shall be given on any suspension or expulsion until pending appeals are exhausted and the IU Convention, ROC or General Convention has acted on it. The relevant body shall order whatever publicity is necessary on the case.

. Confidentiality: All parties involved in a conflict can consult up to two members of their choice and invite them to participate in any meetings about the issue. 
Details of events under investigation and related information are not to be disclosed to third parties not involved in the proceedings. However, if one of the parties involved wants information to be published, results are to be made public within the IWW (with any personal information on individuals involved redacted) by the complaints committee, branch secretary or mediator, depending on the process pursued. Any publication outside the IWW is at the discretion of all concerned, including both complainant and defendant and any other individuals involved in the incident, or subsequent mediation or complaints procedure, and must be endorsed through a formal motion by the General Executive Board.

. Risk of Non-Disclosure:
In the case of harassment, if those involved in the incidents leading to the complaint or mediation process believe that there is a serious risk that the accused will harass other individuals (within or outside the IWW), they must consider making their concerns public following discussion with the accused or their representatives. For this purpose the accused can choose one or two members in good standing with no conflict of interest to serve as their representatives. Any publication must consider potential impacts on the accused against the benefits of disclosure. A report on the issues, including an assessment of such risk of disclosure to the accused must be sent to the General Executive Board contact of the branch or Industrial Union concerned prior to disclosure being pursued.

=== Appeals

==== Section 8

[loweralpha]
. An appeal by either party must be submitted within 30 days of the decision, in writing to the Secretary of the Industrial Union or ROC with jurisdiction, or to the Chair of the GEB for branches affiliated with the General Administration. The appeal shall detail the decision being appealed and reasons why the decision should be reversed. The officer receiving the appeal shall provide copies of the appeal to all parties of the complaint being appealed, including the secretary or alternate of the body whose decision is being appealed.

. The GEB Chair shall notify the GEB upon receipt of an appeal and has 45 days to identify a GMB to hear the appeal. The GEB chair shall work with the GST to identify a list of branches that would be able to elect an appeals committee and have no conflict of interest. Either party may request a branch be removed from the list by providing a substantial reason that it has a conflict of interest. If either party refuses or neglects to participate in the selection of a branch to hear the appeal, that party has waived this right. The GEB shall appoint the branch to hear the appeal by a majority vote.
