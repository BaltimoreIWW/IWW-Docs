== Mediation

=== Section 1

Branches of the IWW should aim to use mediation to resolve conflicts between members of the union that do not present an imminent danger to the union’s interestsor the parties involved.

=== Section 2

Mediation is a constructive dialogue facilitated by a mutually agreed third party, with the goal of finding a resolution to the conflict that is suitable to both parties.

[loweralpha]
. Mediation is by necessity a voluntary process. The precondition of successful mediation is the willingness of both parties to resolve the conflict by mediation.

. If both parties say they are willing to mediate, the branch or branches to which both parties belong shall assist the parties in selecting a mediator acceptable to both parties from their membership.

. The branch or branches can seek assistance from their General Executive Board Contact if they feel unable to do so. If the members involved are not in a branch, they should contact the General Executive Board to help identify a mediator.

. A mediator should be identified no later than two weeks after any incident was reported.

. Participation in mediation does not affect the plaintiff ’s right to lay a formal complaint against the defendant, should mediation fail to resolve the conflict.

. The branch shall reimburse the mediator for any reasonable expenses incurred in the process of conflict mediation.

=== Section 3

[loweralpha]
. The role of the mediator is to listen to both parties, gain a better understanding of the conflict, identify whether it is related to the IWW, search for alternative ways to view the conflict, and assist the parties in identifying ways to resolve the conflict.

. The mediator and parties shall take no more than 30 days to conduct the mediation and report results to the next regular meeting of the branch or branches involved.

. The mediator shall first meet separately or speak by telephone with each party to listen to each member’s concerns. During these conversations, the mediator shall ask each party what they see would resolve the conflict and whether each party would be willing to meet with the other party in the presence of the mediator.

. Based on these conversations, the mediator will identify the next step, which could include, but is not limited to, the following: a second round of mediator-party conversations, a planned meeting of the two parties with the mediator, or the closure of mediation.

. If either party refuses to attend the meeting, or conciliation is not reached, this process can move to the Complaint Procedure outlined in Bylaws Article III.

. At the conclusion of mediation, and no later than six months after the beginning of mediation, whether successful or not, the mediator shall provide a written report to the branch or branches involved, as well as to their General Executive Board contact and General Headquarters. This report shall describe briefly the mediator’s efforts, a summary of what the mediator learned in discussions (while respecting each party’s privacy), the result of the mediation and, if necessary and at the mediator’s discretion, any recommendations for action.

=== Section 4

Jurisdiction, Terms of Immediate Relief, Rights of Members, Confidentiality, Appeals, and Offenses apply as stated in Bylaws, Article III.
