== Resolution Regarding Anti-Fascism and Revolutionary Unionism

Whereas, the Industrial Workers of the World is a revolutionary industrial union that places class struggle at the heart of its organizing and aims ultimately to abolish class society, and

Whereas, since its inception as a union for all workers, it has stood against all oppression, prejudice, and discrimination, and

Whereas, the IWW has historically stood against enemies of the working class and proponents of oppression and discrimination, such as the Ku Klux Klan, and

Whereas, political movements that center around the idea of unity of one race, ethnicity, or cultural group while disparaging, oppressing, and/or casting out perceived others, whether such movements call themselves fascist, white nationalist, white supremacist, ethno-nationalist, racial separatists, Christian Dominionist, Christian Supremacist, or otherwise, are antithetical to the mission and vision of the IWW, both through their oppression and discrimination of fellow members of the working class that are grouped into whatever category they deem as other, as well as in their ideal of collaboration with the ruling classes and suppression of class conflict within the centered group, and

Whereas, the success and capacity for recruitment of these political movements is heavily rooted in their ability to maintain a public presence and operate openly within the society they seek to destroy, and

Therefore be it Resolved, that the Industrial Workers of the World stands against these political ideations as a whole and will take action to oppose their growth and open operation through a strategy of mass anti-fascism and community self defense that is consistent with the aims and principles of the IWW.
