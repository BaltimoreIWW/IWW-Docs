* responding to press inquiries received on iww.org within 48 hours in coordination with any fellow workers or IWW bodies concerned.

==== Accountability

All union bodies are encouraged to liaise with the press officer to coordinate press releases, media contacts and to share information on coverage of the IWW, but the decision on how they present their activities to the media rests with the IWW body or the individual members concerned. Ultimate oversight and responsibility for all IWW publications continue to rest with the General Executive Board as per Article III, Section 5d of the Constitution. Official statements of the organization will continue to require a motion of the General Executive Board, of delegates at the General Convention, or a vote at referendum.

The five candidates receiving the highest number of nominations for press officer at General Convention will have their names placed on the ballot. The press officer will serve a one-year term beginning in January of the following year and can serve a maximum of three consecutive terms. They are expected to remain in good standing while serving in this role. Should a vacancy exist and no alternate be available, the GEB shall appoint a member to fill the vacancy for the remaining term.
