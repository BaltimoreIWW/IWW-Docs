== Resolution on Delegates

WHEREAS elected delegates of the IWW are charged with taking dues, signing up members, and building the IWW, and

WHEREAS elected delegates hold no authority over the membership, but are elected servants of this body, and

WHEREAS a Delegate who refuses to take dues from an IWW member effectively denies that IWW member the ability to remain in good standing, and the ability to participate in our democratic processes.

RESOLVED Delegates shall not have discretion over taking dues from IWW members who have not been suspended or expelled.

RESOLVED It shall be a chargeable offense for any delegate to refuse to take dues or sign up any eligible fellow worker.
