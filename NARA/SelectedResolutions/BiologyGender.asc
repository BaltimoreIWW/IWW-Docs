=== Resolution on Biology and Gender

WHEREAS biology is not destiny and gender is culturally constructed and complex,

WHEREAS all bodies of the IWW should ensure the safety and inclusion of their members regardless of
their gender identity or status or sexual orientation.

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that any and all spaces within the IWW (including, but not limited to, gender-based committees, caucuses and events) should respect the right of individual members to self identify and participate in all union activities according to that self identification.
