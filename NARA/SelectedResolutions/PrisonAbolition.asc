== Statement on Prison Abolition

(((Prison Abolition)))(((Incarcerated Workers)))As a revolutionary organization, the Industrial Workers of the World seeks a total transformation of society, including the abolition of prisons by any means necessary. Prisons are an integral part of capitalism and function as a form of racial and class based social control beyond mere profit making. It is the responsibility of social movements to support individual prisoners incarcerated for their contributions to the cause and targeted for their ongoing efforts and also to focus support on the collective struggle of all prisoners. We regard all prisoners as political prisoners and targets of class war. We regard all prisons as tools of class war.

We support prisoners who use solidarity to struggle against the prison system. Whether a person is in for violent or nonviolent offenses, whether guilty or innocent, whether they are locked up for righteous acts of revolutionary struggle, crimes of survival, or acts of selfishness or intimate interpersonal harm, prisons bring harm to the people and communities they target as well as those they claim to protect. Regardless of political, religious, or organizational affiliation, so long as prisoners are engaged in resistance against their jailers, and are not snitching or acting with the authorities, the Industrial Workers of the World will do what we can to back them up.

We recognize white supremacy as foundational to the prison system. Rooted in power structures reproduced by the state and collective in nature, racism influences the daily realities and material conditions of people of color and Indigenous people in North America. While prisons have not always been used as tools of racial domination, the 13th Amendment of the US Constitution shifted slavery from plantations to prisons, from colonial masters to the capitalist state. The prison-industrial complex mushroomed to the massive proportions our communities experience today - with millions of people behind bars - due to the racist War on Drugs, state repression against the revolutionary movements of the 1970s, particularly Black Power, and neoliberal austerity measures/economic restructuring such as deindustrialization, deinstitutionalization, and the gutting of social welfare programs.

Prisons cage poor people. Due to the history of Black enslavement and Indigenous genocide and the ongoing realities of white supremacy, class war in North America is and always has been colonial and racialized. As abolitionists and anti-capitalist revolutionaries, we recognize the fundamental need for a massive redistribution of wealth to the entire working class that recognizes historical crimes- which includes prisoners, people on welfare, people with disabilities, people working in criminalized economies, homeless people, etc. We recognize the necessity for a multi-racial/multi-national working class revolution to achieve such aims. In the world we envision, no one will struggle to survive day to day. No one will be forced to participate in criminalized economies. All will have access to healthy food, clean water, stable housing, empowering schools, comprehensive health care, etc. Resources spent on prisons and police will be reallocated to create healthy and vibrant communities.

White supremacy as a foundation of the prison system is clear to us, but we also understand and do not shrink from the more difficult implications and aspects of abolition and prisoner organizing. Sexual violence is inseparable from the prisons we wish to abolish. Sexual violence and patriarchy are weaponized in prisons and spill out into the streets. Victims of this sort of violence rarely get any help or opportunity to heal. For those who have intimately harmed and traumatized others, we believe in accountability and transformative justice models. Moreover, an abolitionist framework requires a restructuring of social relations, undoing the harms caused by patriarchy, misogyny, and transmisogyny, recognizing how the prison system perpetuates these harms, and creating a world free of gendered and sexualized violence. Prison hampers processes of transformation and reproduces cycles of trauma. Resources spent on prisons and police could easily be reallocated to create healthy working-class communities. Ultimately, abolition requires a fundamental shift in the distribution of wealth so those living in working-class communities and communities of color are no longer struggling for survival day to day.

We pursue abolition with the core understanding that inside members drive the struggle and will determine their own path to liberation. As a revolutionary social force, prisoners have the power to make the system untenable. Through collective action inside members have and will continue to shut entire facilities down to advance their demands and build power among prisoners. Outside chapters exist to provide critical support for the self organization of prisoners and to build an outside mass movement for freedom and community control. Our struggles, inside and out, are interconnected. Victory means building meaningful class solidarity on both sides of the prison walls. Our goals are collective liberation from white supremacy, gendered oppression, sexual violence, and capitalism and moving towards prosperity, freedom, and a world that does not want or need prisons.
