== Resolution on Use of Union Label on IWW printing

WHEREAS the union label is a universally accepted indicator in the labor movement that work was done by union members, working under union conditions;

WHEREAS the publication of IWW materials without the union label, or an indication that the labor in question was donated, tends to cast doubt among our fellow workers on the integrity and solidarity of this union;

THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED that all printed materials issued by the General Headquarters of this union shall either bear the union label or, if appropriate, a note indicating that the labor to produce them was donated.
