Notification of all referendum items, including the full text of all questions to be voted upon and the names of all nominees for General Administration office who have not declined, shall be provided to all members at least 30 days prior to the issuance of the ballot. Members shall be notified based on their preferred form of GOB mailing. The notice shall specify the deadline for submitting discussion of the referendum items for publication in the GOB. Ballots shall be sent to all members in good standing and shall be open for voting for not less than 30 days and not more than 45 days. The deadline for receipt of ballots at General Headquarters shall be printed on the ballot, but in no event shall be later than November 30. Ballots shall be counted and the results released no later than midnight December 1.
  
. (((Regional Organizing Committee (ROC), Referendum)))Ballots issued by affiliated Regional Organizing Committees on union-wide referenda may be counted by a Regional Organizing Committee ballot committee. The ROC ballot committee must then communicate the results via secured correspondence to the union-wide ballot committee at the General Headquarters.

The chartered branch shall also elect an alternate. If no ballot committee is elected by this time, or if GHQ is located in a city without a chartered branch, then the GEB shall appoint the ballot committee to be composed of three members and an alternate from the chartered branch nearest to GHQ. The ballot committee may appoint other members to assist in the ballot count. In reporting through email and the monthly bulletin the returns of referenda and elections, the General Secretary-Treasurer shall give the names of the ballot committee together with their card numbers and the branch and Industrial Union of which they are members.

. (((Members from outside USA/ROC, Referendum)))Chartered branches, industrial unions or groups of branches or industrial unions not affiliated with a Regional Organizing Committee but outside of the country where Headquarters resides, but within the jurisdiction of the North American Regional Administration, may elect a ballot committee with prior approval of the GEB, in order to ensure no member in good standing is disenfranchised due to delayed ballots, customs or other significant barriers to referendum participation. Such a ballot committee may print and distribute individually numbered ballots to members in good standing as required by circumstances. Ballots must be opened, counted and the results reported no later than midnight December 1. The tallies may not be released before the union-wide results are announced.

Once the ballot is approved by the ballot committee, it will be secured separately from the member’s identifying information.

All ballots must be numbered. Ballots not numbered or from members in bad standing will not be considered valid ballots.

The referendum ballot shall list and clearly label the section or sections to be revised as well as the proposed changes.
  
. (((Referendum, Electronic Balloting)))Electronic Balloting (available via phone & computer) can be used for conducting Referendum as long as a member’s secret ballot cannot be compromised and a ballot cannot be traced back to an individual member, and the service used for electronic balloting has integrity of security.
+ 
Electronic balloting instructions and ballot number will be mailed to members along with the Referendum GOB and Supplement in compliance with the timeline in Article IX of the IWW Constitution with all sections of Article IX of the IWW Constitution in place.
