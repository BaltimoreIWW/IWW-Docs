== Clearinghouse

=== Section 1

[loweralpha]
. The General Headquarters of the Industrial Workers of the World shall function as a Clearinghouse that will automatically settle all debts between Industrial Unions and General Headquarters.
  
. All credentials authorizing members to initiate members or to collect dues shall be issued by the General Secretary-Treasurer. He or she shall issue such credentials on their discretion, on the recommendation of the local or industrial union officers, and must do so on the instruction of the General Executive Board.
+  
Those so credentialed shall have been members for 6 months, except that newly organised groups may elect one of their members to serve in that capacity. All such credentials shall bear a distinguishing number, and shall empower the bearer to initiate members or collect dues in all industries.
  
. The General Secretary-Treasurer may, at the request of a General Membership Branch or Industrial Union Branch, issue blank delegate credentials with distinguishing numbers in blocks of five to the Branch Secretary-Treasurer. The branch may request as many blocks of delegate credentials as needed, and the General Secretary-Treasurer shall attempt to honor all requests for blank credentials. 
+
The General Secretary-Treasurer shall deny issuing blank credentials only if the Branch requesting them has failed to report on time as required by the IWW Constitution. The Branch may elect delegates and issue a set of blank credentials to a new delegate as it sees fit, provided that they meet the conditions outlined in sub-section (b).
+
The newly credentialed delegate shall complete a form issued by the General Secretary-Treasurer that includes background and membership information, as well as a brief explanation for the need for delegate status. A currently credentialed delegate of the branch issuing the new credentials must agree to sponsor the new delegate, and shall co-sign the form. The sponsoring delegate shall be responsible for all actions taken by the new delegate in their duties as a delegate until the General Secretary-Treasurer approves the new delegate.
+
Delegates from General Membership Branches and Industrial Union Branches may sponsor new delegates from any member within a reasonable distance of the branch. The sponsoring branch shall be responsible for outfitting the new delegate with membership supplies.
  
. All job delegates or others bearing such credentials shall record all fees, dues, assessments, etc., collected on the forms provided by the General Secretary and shall identify receipt both on the page of the dues book and on top of the stamps with their credential number and date, and shall report at least monthly to the General Secretary by submitting this record together with all signed applications for membership, and all fees and dues money received; provided, any Industrial Union or Industrial Union Branch, or General Membership Branch, through which the delegate operates may require that this report be transmitted through it to record the information in its own files and to retain such portion of moneys as this Constitution and pertinent Bylaws permit.
  
. The Chairperson of the General Executive Board shall countersign all checks issued by the General Secretary-Treasurer. At the same time as the General Executive Board selects its chair, it shall also select a non-board member to be designated check co-signer. The co-signer will have the same eligibility requirements as a Board member.
  
. Job delegates working out of the general office shall remit all of initiation fees and dues, whether for employed or unemployed members. Secretaries of chartered branches shall remit forty percent of same to the general office and retain sixty percent in the branch treasury.
  
. The GST shall be the custodian of the funds of a General Membership or Industrial Union Branch only upon its request, but they shall be the custodian of the funds of each Industrial Union, except operating funds for which the organisers or officers are, in accordance with the Bylaws, held responsible.
+  
The General Administration cannot use the funds so entrusted to it without the consent of the Industrial Unions or other bodies owning such a fund, so long as these bodies continue.
  
. Supplies issued delegates and branch secretaries on behalf of Industrial Unions shall be charged to the Industrial Union.
  
. Reports with remittance for dues, etc., paid during the month shall be sent to the General Secretary not later than the 10th day of the following month. Should any branch or Industrial Union fail to do so, further supplies to it shall be withheld until these reports are received.
  
. Any candidate for GST wishing to relocate General Headquarters shall so state in their candidate statement, and that intention shall be noted by including the proposed location next to the candidateâ€™s name on the ballot for general officers.
