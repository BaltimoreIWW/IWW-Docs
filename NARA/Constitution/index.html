<a id="user-content-preamble" class="anchor" href="#preamble" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>PREAMBLE</h2>
<p>The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life.</p>
<p>Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organise as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the earth.</p>
<p>We find that the centering of the management of industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the ever-growing power of the employing class. The trade unions foster a state of affairs which allows one set of workers to be pitted against another set of workers in the same industry, thereby helping defeat one another in wage wars. Moreover, the trade unions aid the employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that the working class have interests in common with their employers.</p>
<p>These conditions can be changed and the interest of the working class upheld only by an organization formed in such a way that all its members in any one industry, or in all industries if necessary, cease work whenever a strike or lockout is on in any department thereof, thus making an injury to one an injury to all.</p>
<p>Instead of the conservative motto, ‘’A fair day’s wage for a fair day’s work,” we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, ‘’Abolition of the wage system.”</p>
<p>It is the historic mission of the working class to do away with capitalism. The army of production must be organised, not only for everyday struggle with capitalists, but also to carry on production when capitalism shall have been overthrown. By organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the new society within the shell of the old.</p>
<p>Knowing, therefore, that such an organization is absolutely necessary for emancipation, we unite under the following set of guiding principles and rules:</p>

<ol type="a">
  <li>It is the aim of the IWW to build world-wide working-class solidarity. The IWW therefore actively opposes bigotry and discrimination on and off the job. No wage or salaried worker shall be excluded from the IWW or barred from holding union office because of race, ethnicity, sex, nationality, creed, disability, sexual orientation, or conviction and charges history. Membership of the IWW and officership in the GDC is open only to wage or salaried workers except as provided in ### Section 1(b), but can be denied to those workers whose employment is incompatible with the aims of this union.
  </li>
  <li>No unemployed or retired worker, no working-class student, apprentice, home-maker, prisoner or unwaged volunteer on a project initiated by the IWW or any subordinate body thereof shall be excluded from membership on the grounds that they are not currently receiving wages. Such workers may take membership in the Industrial Union for the industry in which they last worked, or for which they are now training, or at which they work part-time, or in the case of students and homemakers in Educational Workers I.U. 620 or Household Service Workers I.U. 680 respectively as may seem most practical.
<p>This provision shall not deny to any Industrial Union or Industrial Union Branch the right to limit vote on strictly point-of-production matters. Workers employed in co-operatives democratically run by their employees are welcome to membership. Members who become temporarily self-employed may retain their membership or apply for withdrawal cards, which are issuable also to those who must withdraw when they become employers.</p>
  </li>  
  <li>No member of the Industrial Workers of the World shall be an officer of a trade or craft union or political party.
<p>Branches may allow IWW members to become officers of trade or craft unions as long as these exceptions are reported to the General Administration and no IWW member receives significant pay (more than dues rebate and expenses) as a result of being an officer or official in a union that does not call for abolition of the wage system.</p>
<p>Exceptions may be made by branches to allow unpaid officers of political parties to become members.</p>
  </li>
  <li>No Law Enforcement Officer (LEO), certified by the government to enforce the law, and no Prison Guard, whether employed by the government or a private company, shall be a member of the IWW, and any member who becomes such shall be expelled.

Members who collect rent from housemates, renting out the other half of a duplex, and members who are renting out their second home shall be exempt from this ban. A Branch at their own discretion may vote to retain a current member in violation of this clause.

<ol type="a">
  <li>The Industrial Unions shall have autonomous right to set their own initiation fees, dues and assessments, other than General Organizational assessments. It is the policy of the IWW to put no financial barrier to prevent any worker from joining. Accordingly, initiations shall not exceed $33.00 nor monthly dues exceed $33.00.
<p>All Industrial Unions and Industrial Union Branches shall charge sufficient dues to meet their obligations and cover their expenses. No part of the initiation fees or dues mentioned above shall be used as a sick or death benefit, but shall be held in the treasury as a general fund to defray legitimate expenses.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Industrial Unions and Industrial Union Branches shall have autonomous right to set their own initiation fees, dues and assessments. However, such dues must be set at a rate that enables continued per capita payments. These payments are for the General Administration and chartered bodies (such as General Membership Branches and their successors) as described in (e) below.
  </li>
  <li>It is the policy of the IWW that no financial barrier shall prevent any worker from joining. Accordingly, Industrial Unions and Industrial Union Branches shall not set excessive initiation fees or dues. In no case shall Industrial Union or Industrial Union Branch initiation fees or monthly dues exceed two times the straight time hourly wage of the member.
  </li>
  <li>Dues paid by Industrial Union Branch members to their delegates consist of three parts:
    <ol>
      <li>Industrial Union Branch dues
      </li>
      <li>Per capita due to General Administration, defined as fifty percent of the amount mandated under subsection (a) above;
      </li>
      <li>Per capita due to the local General Membership Branch or its successors, which amount shall be negotiated between these bodies and the Industrial Union Branch.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>The GEB is authorized at its discretion to waive the initiation fee or reduce it to a nominal fee when incorporating previously organized workers or in organizing campaigns among especially distressed workers. The GEB is further authorised to waive dues payments in the event of a strike or lockout.
  </li>
  <li>All dues stamps for all Industrial Unions must be of the same design without the price printed on them.
  </li>
  <li>A page shall be provided in the credentials fully stating the initiating fee and the dues charged by every Industrial Union for the information of delegates and branch secretaries.
  </li>
  <li>Members in Inactive Standing may reinitiate their membership by paying an initiation fee along with one month’s dues upon reinitiation or by paying, in full, any back dues at the current dues rate. Any person reinitiating their membership shall be assigned the same membership number in which they were originally assigned upon their first initiation. If a replacement card is needed upon reinitiation, the Branch or General Headquarters shall issue the replacement at no additional charge.
  </li>
  <li>For members in Canada and the U.S. dues shall be set as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>$11 per month for workers earning less than $2000 per month.
      </li>
      <li>$22 per month for workers earning between $2000 and $3500 per month.
      </li>
      <li>$33 per month for workers earning more than $3500 per month.
      </li>
    </ol>
Sub-minimum dues of $6 per month may be paid by members in poor economic circumstances. Dues of members in the sub-minimum category who belong to organized branches shall be apportioned as follows: $3 to the General Administration, $3 to the branch.
<p>Initiation fees shall be equal to one month’s dues. Each new member shall be provided a copy of the One Big Union pamphlet.
</p>
</li>
  <li>Regional Organizing Committees shall set dues for members in their regions. Dues for members in regions without ROCs shall be set, in local currency, by the GEB in consultation with members in those regions.
  </li>
  <li>The General Executive Board is authorized at its discretion to allow 50% of the dues and initiations collected to be retained by those involved in an organizing campaign provided the delegates involved report on the progress of such campaigns to the General Executive Board monthly, and account for all money received and spent.
  </li>
  <li>Every four years the General Convention shall elect a committee of three members in good standing to serve on the Dues Adjustment Committee.  General Convention may strike the committee early or postpone the striking of the committee as it sees fit. The purpose of this committee shall be to investigate whether the current dues rates support the needs of both the General Administration as well as local branches and to study the effects of inflation on dues rates and brackets. The committee shall bring its recommendations to the following year’s General Convention.

  <li>A referendum on any organization question, including constitutional amendments, may be initiated by the General Executive Board, or by a petition of 5% of members not in bad standing. The number of members at the beginning of each calendar year will be used for the entire year in determining total membership.
  </li>
  <li>All properly submitted referendum items shall be included on a ballot to be issued each year no later than October 15. Notification of all referendum items, including the full text of all questions to be voted upon and the names of all nominees for General Administration office who have not declined, shall be provided to all members at least 30 days prior to the issuance of the ballot. Members shall be notified based on their preferred form of GOB mailing. The notice shall specify the deadline for submitting discussion of the referendum items for publication in the GOB. Ballots shall be sent to all members in good standing and shall be open for voting for not less than 30 days and not more than 45 days. The deadline for receipt of ballots at General Headquarters shall be printed on the ballot, but in no event shall be later than November 30. Ballots shall be counted and the results released no later than midnight December 1.
  </li>
  <li>Ballots issued by affiliated Regional Organizing Committees on union-wide referenda may be counted by a Regional Organizing Committee ballot committee. The ROC ballot committee must then communicate the results via secured correspondence to the union-wide ballot committee at the General Headquarters. The ROC results shall be opened at the same time as all individual ballots. The tallies of individual ROCs may not be announced before the union-wide tally.
  </li>
  <li>The returns of the referendum shall remain in General Headquarters in sealed envelopes until the ballot committee meets. The ballot committee shall meet immediately on expiration of the time set for the return of ballots. The General Secretary-Treasurer shall notify the body initiating referendum of the date set for count of ballots.
  </li>
  <li>The ballot committee to count the votes on the referendum shall be composed as follows: Three members in continuous good standing for 1 year prior to their election to the committee shall be elected by the chartered branch in the city in which Headquarters is located no later than ten (10) days before the ballots are to be counted. The chartered branch shall also elect an alternate. If no ballot committee is elected by this time, or if GHQ is located in a city without a chartered branch, then the GEB shall appoint the ballot committee to be composed of three members and an alternate from the chartered branch nearest to GHQ. The ballot committee may appoint other members to assist in the ballot count. In reporting through email and the monthly bulletin the returns of referenda and elections, the General Secretary-Treasurer shall give the names of the ballot committee together with their card numbers and the branch and Industrial Union of which they are members.
  </li>
  <li>The Industrial Union or body initiating a referendum shall pay the expenses of its own delegates on the ballot committee unless the referendum is carried, in which event the expenses shall be borne by the general organization.
  </li>
  <li>Chartered branches, industrial unions or groups of branches or industrial unions not affiliated with a Regional Organizing Committee but outside of the country where Headquarters resides, but within the jurisdiction of the North American Regional Administration, may elect a ballot committee with prior approval of the GEB, in order to ensure no member in good standing is disenfranchised due to delayed ballots, customs or other significant barriers to referendum participation. Such a ballot committee may print and distribute individually numbered ballots to members in good standing as required by circumstances. Ballots must be opened, counted and the results reported no later than midnight December 1. The tallies may not be released before the union-wide results are announced.
  </li>
  <li>Ballots shall be prepared in such a way as to assure complete secrecy in voting and shall be in duplicate form to allow the member to retain a record of their vote. Ballots shall contain no information identifying the ballot with the member who sent it. All information pertaining to the member’s name and standing will be entered onto the voucher envelope. Once the ballot is approved by the ballot committee, it will be secured separately from the member’s identifying information.
<p>All ballots must be numbered. Ballots not numbered or from members in bad standing will not be considered valid ballots.</p>
<p>Any members whose ballots have been invalidated shall be notified by first class mail within seven (7) days of the decision by the Ballot Committee, explaining the reason their ballot was invalidated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>All constitutional changes ratified by a general referendum ballot shall take effect January 1, unless otherwise decided by the General Convention.
  </li>
  <li>Any part of this General Constitution may be suspended or set aside for 1 year if so approved by a general referendum, initiated as provided for in Section 2(a) of this Article.
  </li>
  <li>All proposed constitutional amendments which remove constitutional language to a section or sections of the Constitution shall list the section or sections to be revised in addition to separately listing the proposed changes. The referendum ballot shall list and clearly label the section or sections to be revised as well as the proposed changes.
  </li>
  <li>Electronic Balloting (available via phone &amp; computer) can be used for conducting Referendum as long as a member’s secret ballot cannot be compromised and a ballot cannot be traced back to an individual member, and the service used for electronic balloting has integrity of security.
<p>Electronic balloting instructions and ballot number will be mailed to members along with the Referendum GOB and Supplement in compliance with the timeline in Article IX of the IWW Constitution with all sections of Article IX of the IWW Constitution in place.</p>
<p>All members retain the ability to opt out of electronic balloting and may then receive paper ballots.</p>
