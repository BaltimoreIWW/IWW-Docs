Whenever five or more Industrial Union Branches(((Industrial Union Branch (IUB)))) with a combined membership of no less than 100 have been attained in any industry, the General Executive Board shall issue an Industrial Union charter upon receipt of a petition signed by two-thirds of the combined membership of said Industrial Union Branches.

==== Section 8

All charters of Industrial Unions, ROCs and local bodies where no ROC exists shall be issued by the GEB(((General Executive Board (GEB), Charters))). In industries where the IWW includes a functioning Industrial Union, charters shall be issued only on recommendation of its General Organizing Committee.

In other industries it shall be permissible for local General Membership Branches(((General Membership Branch (GMB)))) to organize and administer local bodies of workers in any industry until they apply for and are granted Industrial Union Branch charters.

In localities where there is one or more Industrial Union Branch(es) and a General Membership Branch, it shall be locally optional either to set up a delegate council to handle matters of common concern (such as educational, defense, and social activities) or to leave these to the General Membership Branch, with the sharing of financial obligations to be arranged between them(((Shared Responsibilties, GMB and IUB))). Where no General Membership Branch is chartered, it is expected of all members of the IWW to arrange for occasional at which any and all members, whether they are members of Industrial Union Branches or not, may meet together to plan local joint activities.

Charters shall be issued to GMBs or to IUBs only if the GEB finds it feasible for their members to meet together. More than one GMB in the same city or area shall be chartered only when the GEB finds language, transportation, or other practical reasons warrant it.
