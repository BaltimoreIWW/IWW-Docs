Industrial Unions
-----------------

Section 5
~~~~~~~~~

a. Industrial Unions shall be composed of actual wage workers in a given industry welded together as the particular requirements of said industry may render neces- sary.
b. Whenever five or more Industrial Union Branches with a combined membership of no less than 100 have been attained in any industry, the General Executive Board shall issue an Industrial Union charter upon receipt of a petition signed by two-thirds of the combined membership of said Industrial Union Branches.
c. An Industrial Union, once chartered, shall act to convene a Convention or Assembly to adopt Industrial Union Bylaws and a uniform Industrial Union dues structure, and to nominate Industrial Union officers to be elected by mail ballot of the membership of said Industrial Union.
d. Industrial Union Branches in the same industry without a chartered Industrial Union are encouraged to establish coordinating bodies consistent with Section 5 hereof.

Section 6
~~~~~~~~~

Component parts of the IWW may set up such coordinating bodies as they wish, provided their cost shall be defrayed by the sections setting them up, and further provided that they shall not void rank and file control.

Section 7
~~~~~~~~~

No legislation conflicting with the Constitution of the IWW shall be passed by any subordinate body.

Section 8
~~~~~~~~~

All charters of Industrial Unions, ROCs and local bodies where no ROC exists shall be issued by the GEB. In industries where the IWW includes a functioning Industrial Union, charters shall be issued only on recommendation of its General Organizing Committee.

In other industries it shall be permissible for local General Membership Branches to organize and administer local bodies of workers in any industry until they apply for and are granted Industrial Union Branch charters.

In localities where there is one or more Industrial Union Branch(es) and a General Membership Branch, it shall be locally optional either to set up a delegate council to handle matters of common concern (such as educational, defense, and social activities) or to leave these to the General Membership Branch, with the sharing of financial obligations to be arranged between them. Where no General Membership Branch is chartered, it is expected of all members of the IWW to arrange for occasional at which any and all members, whether they are members of Industrial Union Branches or not, may meet together to plan local joint activities.

Charters shall be issued to GMBs or to IUBs only if the GEB finds it feasible for their members to meet together. More than one GMB in the same city or area shall be chartered only when the GEB finds language, transportation, or other practical reasons warrant it.

Regional Organizing Committees
------------------------------

Section 9
~~~~~~~~~

a. Regional Organizing Committees are subordinate regional ###Sections of the IWW. Whenever there are 10 or more members of the IWW        in a region, they may petition the GEB to form a ROC.

b. ROCs may set their dues structure, local branch sizes and elect officers. Services provided to individual ROCs shall be negotiated between the ROC and General Administration.

c. ROCs may print membership cards and issue stamps in the local language(s). The membership numbers for the cards shall be provided by General Headquarters.

d. ROCs will negotiate with the General Administration for services and a per capita for international organizing activities.

e. All ROCs will be required to set up an Organizing Bulletin or other method of internal discussion accessible to members within that ROC. The local Organizing Bulletins shall contain an international report from the GST and GEB which shall be provided to the ROC on a monthly basis.

f. In the absence of a ROC in a region, one or more individuals may be delegated by regional members, or by the GST, for a period of one year for the purpose of organizing a ROC. Such delegates shall report at least quarterly to the GST, and may retain all dues and initiation fees collected. The default dues for members from countries outside the USA or from countries without an established Regional Organizing Committee will be 1% of take home pay, unless that creates an undue hardship on the member at the discretion of the delegate.
