== Initiation Fees & Dues

=== Section 2

[loweralpha]
. The Industrial Unions shall have autonomous right to set their own initiation fees, dues and assessments, other than General Organizational assessments. It is the policy of the IWW to put no financial barrier to prevent any worker from joining. Accordingly, initiations shall not exceed $33.00 nor monthly dues exceed $33.00.
+  
All Industrial Unions and Industrial Union Branches shall charge sufficient dues to meet their obligations and cover their expenses. No part of the initiation fees or dues mentioned above shall be used as a sick or death benefit, but shall be held in the treasury as a general fund to defray legitimate expenses.
  
. Industrial Unions and Industrial Union Branches shall have autonomous right to set their own initiation fees, dues and assessments. However, such dues must be set at a rate that enables continued per capita payments. These payments are for the General Administration and chartered bodies (such as General Membership Branches and their successors) as described in (e) below.
  
. It is the policy of the IWW that no financial barrier shall prevent any worker from joining. Accordingly, Industrial Unions and Industrial Union Branches shall not set excessive initiation fees or dues. In no case shall Industrial Union or Industrial Union Branch initiation fees or monthly dues exceed two times the straight time hourly wage of the member.
  
. Dues paid by Industrial Union Branch members to their delegates consist of three parts:
[arabic]    
.. Industrial Union Branch dues
      
.. Per capita due to General Administration, defined as fifty percent of the amount mandated under subsection (a) above;
      
.. Per capita due to the local General Membership Branch or its successors, which amount shall be negotiated between these bodies and the Industrial Union Branch.
        
. The GEB is authorized at its discretion to waive the initiation fee or reduce it to a nominal fee when incorporating previously organized workers or in organizing campaigns among especially distressed workers. The GEB is further authorised to waive dues payments in the event of a strike or lockout.
  
. All dues stamps for all Industrial Unions must be of the same design without the price printed on them.
  
. A page shall be provided in the credentials fully stating the initiating fee and the dues charged by every Industrial Union for the information of delegates and branch secretaries.
  
. Members in Inactive Standing may reinitiate their membership by paying an initiation fee along with one month’s dues upon reinitiation or by paying, in full, any back dues at the current dues rate. Any person reinitiating their membership shall be assigned the same membership number in which they were originally assigned upon their first initiation. If a replacement card is needed upon reinitiation, the Branch or General Headquarters shall issue the replacement at no additional charge.
  
. For members in Canada and the U.S. dues shall be set as follows:
    
.. $11 per month for workers earning less than $2000 per month.
      
.. $22 per month for workers earning between $2000 and $3500 per month.
      
.. $33 per month for workers earning more than $3500 per month.     
+    
Sub-minimum dues of $6 per month may be paid by members in poor economic circumstances. Dues of members in the sub-minimum category who belong to organized branches shall be apportioned as follows: $3 to the General Administration, $3 to the branch.
+
Initiation fees shall be equal to one month’s dues. Each new member shall be provided a copy of the One Big Union pamphlet.
   
. Regional Organizing Committees shall set dues for members in their regions. Dues for members in regions without ROCs shall be set, in local currency, by the GEB in consultation with members in those regions.
  
. The General Executive Board is authorized at its discretion to allow 50% of the dues and initiations collected to be retained by those involved in an organizing campaign provided the delegates involved report on the progress of such campaigns to the General Executive Board monthly, and account for all money received and spent.
  
. Every four years the General Convention shall elect a committee of three members in good standing to serve on the Dues Adjustment Committee.  General Convention may strike the committee early or postpone the striking of the committee as it sees fit. The purpose of this committee shall be to investigate whether the current dues rates support the needs of both the General Administration as well as local branches and to study the effects of inflation on dues rates and brackets. The committee shall bring its recommendations to the following year’s General Convention.
