=== Membership

[loweralpha]

Membership of the IWW and officership in the GDC is open only to wage or salaried workers except as provided in ==== Section 1(b), but can be denied to those workers whose employment is incompatible with the aims of this union.
  
. No unemployed or retired worker, no working-class student, apprentice, home-maker, prisoner or unwaged volunteer on a project initiated by the IWW or any subordinate body thereof shall be excluded from membership on the grounds that they are not currently receiving wages. Such workers may take membership in the Industrial Union for the industry in which they last worked, or for which they are now training, or at which they work part-time, or in the case of students and homemakers in Educational Workers I.U. 620 or Household Service Workers I.U. 680 respectively as may seem most practical.

. No person whose primary income (over 50% for at least 90 days) comes from being a landlord, shall be allowed membership, and any member who becomes one shall be expelled.

A Branch at their own discretion may vote to retain a current member in violation of this clause.
