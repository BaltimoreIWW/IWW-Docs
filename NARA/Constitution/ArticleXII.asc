== Unemployed Members

=== Section 1

Except where Industrial Unions provide otherwise, any member whose income for the preceding month has been less than $1000 shall be entitled to pay dues for that month at the sub-minimum rate of six dollars per month, this to include students working part-time. If a member pays more than one month in advance and later the memberâ€™s income changes to above $1000, that member must pay the difference in dues with respect to the new income beginning with the month that it changed.

Special sub-minimum income dues stamps shall be issued by the Clearinghouse, and shall be entered separately in all accounts.

=== Section 2

Members with sub-minimum income dues stamps are entitled to full rights and privileges; representation at Assemblies shall in no way discriminate between the two types of dues; except as otherwise provided those paying sub-minimum income dues shall be required to pay all assessments due from employed members.
