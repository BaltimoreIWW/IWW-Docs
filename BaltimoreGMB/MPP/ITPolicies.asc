=== Section 1 : IT Committee Administrative policies

IT Committee must consist of a minimum of two members in good standing.

Admin credentials/access for branch-wide technology resources must be held by two or more IT Committee members at all times. Credentials must be kept secure and private.

Members of the IT Committee may be recalled by a majority vote of the GMB.

=== Section 2 : Policies for all communications platforms

Only members in good standing shall be eligible for access to communications platforms (with exceptions for Discord as laid out in the Discord section)

Member access shall be deactivated when they fall into bad standing (includes the 2-month grace period as per our bylaws) or when they violate the policies laid out here.

Users are to keep their login credentials secure.

Users are prohibited from sharing screenshots or other documentation of communications outside of (1) Baltimore GMB membership, (2) for the purposes of filing an official charge/complaint as laid out in the IWW Constitution, or (3) to be submitted to the IT Committee as evidence of violation of IWW policies.

Code names must be used in discussions of non-public campaigns. If unsure whether a campaign is public, assume it is not.

Devices including but not limited to phones, laptops, and desktop computers used to access Discord and Baltimore GMB file storage must be password protected. Device encryption is encouraged. Members should endeavor to protect devices from physical attacks/seizure.

It should be assumed that all data and communications that take place over Baltimore GMB platforms are not private.

Discussion of any illegal activities on Union communications platforms is prohibited and will be removed.

Communications platforms are subject to the Baltimore GMB's Safer Spaces policy as outlined in Article IX of the bylaws as of December 2018.

The membership is obligated to report violations of the above policies to the IT Committee. The IT Committee will temporarily suspend accounts it finds to be in violation until the adjournment of the next GMB business meeting, during which the IT Committee shall report on the matter, leaving further actions to be taken at the discretion of the GMB.

=== Section 3 : Email

Announcements and communications that should be accessible to all members of the GMB shall be sent to the general membership listserv. Discord, texts, or other (non-email) platforms are not sufficient for communications intended for the entire membership.
Other listservs may be created for internal or external communications at the discretion of relevant committees and campaigns. Requests for the creation of additional listservs should be submitted to the IT committee. Creation of these listservs should be announced to the GMB.

The main Baltimore IWW email account should be monitored only by the Communications Officer, the Branch Secretary, and others delegated at the discretion of the GMB, all of whom shall possess the credentials for that account.
Email aliases on the Baltimore GMB domain (i.e., alias@baltimoreiww.org) shall be available to all official committees and shall be created by the IT Committee on request.

=== Section 4 : Discord

The Discord instant messaging platform is intended to serve as a coordination and planning medium for IWW activities. Announcements, meeting minutes, or other information intended for the membership of the Baltimore GMB in general shall be communicated using the branch email list. It should be assumed that any communications that take place on Discord are not private.

Access to the branch Discord server shall be granted to members once their good standing is verified by the Branch Secretary. Access may be revoked for being in inactive standing.

Moderation shall be provided by branch officers and shall conform to the policies of the GMB. “User Roles” shall be used to control access to privileged information (e.g., branch officer business, non-public organizing campaigns, etc.).
