== CAMPAIGNS COMMITTEE BYLAWS

The Campaigns Committee of the Baltimore Branch of the IWW is being formed in order to further the mission of the IWW: to organize the working class for power and solidarity. We acknowledge that the pervasive myth of White supremacy has been a major factor in eroding solidarity and allowing the employing classes to more effectively divide and conquer. The IWW has historically suffered from, as well as reproduced these problems in it’s own organization both locally and internationally. We aspire to racial and cultural humility, commit to continuing to learn about racial justice and hope to make this committee a welcoming space for all!
