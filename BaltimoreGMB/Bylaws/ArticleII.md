## ARTICLE II : MEETINGS

### Section 1

The Baltimore GMB shall meet on the second Tuesday of every month; the meeting shall promptly start at 7:30pm and adjourn by 9:30pm. The meeting may be extended by means of a two-thirds vote by the membership for the specified meeting. 

Special meetings may be called by notifying GMB members by face to face contact, phone call, or e-mail. Meetings may be rescheduled by a majority vote.

As defined in the IWW Constitution, quorum is five members in good standing.

### Section 2

GMB Meetings shall be open to all workers, though non-members can be excluded from any meeting by a majority vote of members in good standing. Voting privileges shall be reserved for IWW members in good standing, as defined by the IWW constitution. Good standing shall be demonstrated by each member passing their red card to the member to their left for review during the “Card Check” portion of business meetings or as verified by the members’ delegate.

### Section 3

GMB Members attending branch meetings shall be eligible to take part in the business of the meeting if they are in good standing as defined by the IWW Constitution. If members wish to pay dues at the meeting, they shall do so before the meeting is called to order.

### Section 4

Except where otherwise noted in these bylaws, meetings shall follow the rules and procedures set forth in Rusty’s Rules of Order, which shall be made available to all members. Additional exceptions to Rusty’s Rules of Order may be approved by a two-thirds vote by the members in good standing at the meeting.

### Section 5 : Meeting Facilitation

Meetings shall be chaired by two co-facilitators. While one co-facilitator focuses on the agenda, the other co-facilitator shall take stack and call on participants. Rather than strictly following the order in which hands were raised, the co-facilitators shall utilize a “progressive stack”, prioritizing participants who have not spoken as often and ensuring that there are ample opportunities for women, people of color, LGBTQ people and other members of oppressed or marginalized groups to be heard. The same people should not facilitate more than two meetings in a row. New members are expected to undergo a facilitation training within 6 months of joining the branch.

### Section 6 : Emergency motions

Official branch motions will be made at the regularly scheduled monthly GMB meetings. Only if an emergency situation arises where a decision must be made before the next GMB meeting, the following requirements must be observed:

<ol type="a">
  <li>Any member in good standing may propose a motion via email, which may be seconded by any other member in good standing.
  </li>
  <li>The emergency motion and the circumstances surrounding it must be sent out to the branch email list at least 24 hours before voting is closed. The branch secretary will then release to all members a count of all members in good standing and the deadline by which the votes will be counted.
  </li>
  <li>Emergency motions may not disburse more than $100. Sums larger than this must be brought to the monthly GMB meeting.
  </li>
  <li>Quorum shall be no fewer than five members voting in support.
  </li>
</ol>
