## ARTICLE VII : WORKER OWNED CO-OPERATIVES

### Section 1

The Baltimore IWW will maintain an ongoing relationship of mutual aid and cooperation with the two IWW worker-owned cooperatives in Baltimore: Red Emmaâ€™s Coffeehouse and Bookstore and Baltimore Bicycle Works.

### Section 2

All full members of the two aforementioned cooperatives are also individual members of the Baltimore General Membership Branch of the IWW and have the same rights and responsibilities as other branch members. Coop members are encouraged to actively participate in branch meetings, committees and campaigns, to vote in branch and union-wide elections and to run for branch and union-wide office. Co-op members are individually responsible for paying their dues and maintaining good standing in the IWW. Members who leave a cooperative remain members of the branch unless they resign from the IWW, move to the jurisdiction of a different GMB, stop paying dues or are expelled.

### Section 3

Co-ops are encouraged to nominate at least one member to become a branch delegate. This delegate, if elected by the branch, will serve as an official liaison between the co-op and the branch by giving a report at GMB and coop meetings and transferring reports and dues to the branch.

### Section 4

The Baltimore GMB recognizes the independence of the co-operatives and has no authority over their internal affairs. The GMB does not seek to control or influence the decision-making process of the co-operatives. Certified IWW worker-owned cooperatives answer only to their members and to the international body of the IWW as outlined in the IWW Constitution.
