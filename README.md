# IWW-Docs
Industrial Workers of the World

This is a repository for the governing documents of the Industrial Workers of the World.

The documents generated by these source files are currently hosted on [the Baltimore IWW GMB website](https://docs.baltimoreiww.org).

Subfolders contain documents in .asc (AsciiDoc) format. AsciiDoc contains the unfortunate standard of (((triple parenthesis))) syntax for marking entries to appear in the auto-generated index of the pdf document. If you see these in the source .asc files, don't be alarmed. The only conspiracy going on here is to secretly arrange entries to appear in the index.
