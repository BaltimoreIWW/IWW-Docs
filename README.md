# IWW-Docs
Industrial Workers of the World

This is a repository for the governing documents of the Industrial Workers of the World.

Subfolders contain documents in .asc (AsciiDoc) format, which represent chunks of each governing document (Articles, in the case of the Constitution, for example). The scripts within this repository combine the chunks into a single document and then generate more human-readable html and pdf files from them to be hosted on a website or printed, etc.

Note: the AsciiDoc standard contains the unfortunate syntax of (((triple parenthesis))) used for marking entries to appear in the auto-generated index of the pdf document. If you see these in the source .asc files, don't be alarmed!

The documents generated by these source files are currently hosted on [the Baltimore IWW GMB website](https://docs.baltimoreiww.org).
